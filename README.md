# halluciTATE

This project is a refactored pipeline of an initial MSc project, built to be reproducible and scalable for input of large numbers of proteins. The aim of the project is to be able to identify AI generated proteins that are hallucinated. It is also a pun on my surname.

Work is currently in progress to refactor existing code. Bear with me.

# Requires (definitely not finished!):

- BioPython
- Hugging Face
- EvoProtGrad
- Phenix Molprobity
