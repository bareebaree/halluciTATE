#Project Overview
This project is divided into three major phases:

1. Purposefully making a model hallucinate proteins, and identifying common features of hallucinated proteins.
2. Identifying knowledge neurons and looking in the attention matrices to see how models are making decisions that lead to hallucinations.
3. Building a classifier to identify hallucinated proteins.

Phase 1 has been finished, and phase 2 is about to begin.


In terms of code, phase 1 is split into two parts: pipeline (produces hallucinations), and analysis (wide series of evaluation metrics and visualisation to identify what the common features are).

In the ./pipeline folder, the __main__.py file allows large parts of the pipeline to be run from the command line, and requires a TSV of desired PDB IDs from Interprot as input.

Specifically, __main__.py allows for the steps of downloading relevant fasta files for input, embedding them into vector space, clustering them with K-means, evolving the proteins, then running melt temperature predicction on them all to be done through the command line, taking the desired protein family as input.
